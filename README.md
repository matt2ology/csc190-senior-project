# CSC 190: Senior Project - Part I

The first of a two-course sequence in which student teams undertake an industry-grade a project to develop and 
deliver a software product. Teams apply software engineering principles in the preparation of a software 
proposal, a project management plan, a software product backlog, and a high-fidelity prototype. All technical 
work is published using guidelines modeled after IEEE documentation standards. Oral and written reports are 
required. Lecture one hour, laboratory three hours.
