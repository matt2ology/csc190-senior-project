# CSC 191 - Writing Assignment

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to provide you with a detailed account of my senior project
experience at California State University, Sacramento (CSUS). As a Computer
Science graduate with a strong foundation in software development, I am excited
to share the insights and skills I gained during my senior project, as I
believe they align well with the expectations of a dynamic and forward-thinking
company like yours.

Project Overview:
For my senior project, I had the opportunity to work on a web application for
Sierra College, a community college, located in Rocklin California. The project,
titled " Sierra College Alumni Network," was a collaborative effort with a team
of 8, each bringing their unique skills and perspectives to the table.

Problem Statement:

The project's objective was to establish an online platform facilitating alumni
connections and the exchange of relevant information. During our research phase,
in collaboration with our client, we identified the college's desire for a
user-friendly interface. This interface would enable alumni and current enrolled
students to effortlessly create and manage profiles, share updates on events and
job opportunities, and engage with each other; in addition, **introduce an
additional channel for patrons to make direct donations to the Sierra College
Foundation**, thereby supporting programs, services, and students at Sierra College.

Our team, operating under the moniker "byte-syzed," was resolute in developing
a solution that not only addressed these challenges but also introduced an
innovative approach to fostering grassroots initiatives, nurturing student and
alumni pride, and establishing peer-to-peer networking. Beyond alumni connections,
the website was designed to serve as a networking hub for students, allowing
them to connect with alumni and glean insights from their experiences and expertise.

Technical Stack:
We employed a comprehensive technical stack for our project, showcasing our
proficiency with a diverse set of industry-standard technologies. Key components
of our technical stack comprised JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL,
the Jest library for testing, and AWS for deployment. The selection of these
technologies was deliberate, chosen strategically to guarantee the scalability,
efficiency, and maintainability of our solution.

Project Phases:
The development process was divided into two semesters
(CSC 190: Senior Project - Part I in Spring 2023 and
CSC 191: Senior Project - Part II in Fall 2023), allowing us to manage the
project effectively and deliver incremental value. These phases included:

CSC 190 - Requirements Analysis: conducted thorough research to understand the
problem domain and define clear project requirements. This phase involved close
collaboration with stakeholders to ensure alignment with their needs and
expectations.

CSC 190 - Design and Architecture: Employing industry best practices, we
crafted a robust and scalable architecture that formed the foundation of our
solution. This phase included detailed design documents, outlining the system's
structure and how various components interacted.

CSC 191 - Implementation: Leveraging agile development methodologies, we
transitioned from design to implementation. Regular sprints, code reviews, and
continuous integration ensured that our codebase remained of high quality and
aligned with project objectives.

CSC 191 - Testing and Quality Assurance: Rigorous testing was integral to our
development process. We implemented a comprehensive testing strategy, covering
unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing to guarantee the
reliability and performance of our solution.

CSC 191 - Deployment and Optimization: The final phase involved deploying our
solution in a real-world environment. We closely monitored its performance,
gathering user feedback and making iterative improvements to optimize
functionality and user experience.

Lessons Learned:
Throughout the project, I gained invaluable insights into teamwork,
problem-solving, and project management. Working collaboratively with diverse
team members allowed me to appreciate the importance of effective communication
and adaptability. I also honed my ability to analyze complex problems, break
them down into manageable tasks, and implement efficient solutions.

Future Development and Recommendations:
Upon reflection on the project, there are potential areas for improvement.
An example is the choice of framework; at the time, we opted for ReactJS and
NodeJS without exploring alternative options. This decision was influenced by a
desire to align with other senior project teamâ€™s choices in anticipation of
encountering similar issues. In hindsight, considering the nature of the project,
Django could have been a more suitable choice. Django offers ease of ramp-up,
built-in features like an admin interface, a streamlined database API (SQL Lite),
and crucial security measures such as the inclusion of a cross-site request
forgery token (csrf_token).

Conclusion:
In conclusion, my senior project experience has equipped me with the skills and
mindset needed to thrive in a professional software development environment.
I am confident that the hands-on experience, technical proficiency, and
collaborative approach developed during this project make me an ideal candidate
for a position at TheCompany.

I am eager to discuss my senior project in more detail during the upcoming
interview, where I hope to convey the passion and dedication that drove our
team to success. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills to
your esteemed organization and contribute to the innovative projects that I
know your company is renowned for.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of
joining your team and contributing to the success of TheCompany.

Sincerely,

Matthew Mendoza
